## üë®‚Äçüíª Development

### ‚è±Ô∏è Getting started

This turborepo uses [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) as a package manager. Start by cloning the repository
and run

```
npm install -g yarn
```

Install dependencies, run

```
yarn
```

You can build only the packages you work on, but if you want to build everything to start with, run

```
yarn build:all
```

### üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Working on a package

Packages in the repository usually have some common scripts to make development easier. These are
labeled by the following keywords : `build`, `test`, `dev`, and `lint`.

The `dev` commands wrap package specific needs into a single command for development. Take for
example the [MAD Components](./packages/components/) package. Since any change in its code requires
a build for the [MAD Chronicles](./apps/chronicles/) app to refresh, we define the `dev` script in
the components package to build with the `watch` flag. A developer working on the component library
does not need to bother with these details, so running

```
yarn dev:chronicles
yarn dev:components
```

is all that is required.

This is how development on the packages is set up. With some exceptions, you can run any of these
scripts with

```
yarn {keyword}:{package-alias}
```

Head into the project root [package.json](./package.json) for a full list of all commands.

### üôè Contributing to the repository

#### Branching

We use
[Trunk-based development](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development)
in this repository. Branching is done in and out of the `main` branch for each update.

#### Pull requests

Pull requests into main should as a rule of thumb ALWAYS contain a changeset (see:
[Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)). You create these by running

```
yarn changeset
```

and follow the promts. This way, changelogs and version bumps are automatically handeled. Also note
that we use
[semantic](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716/raw/e75b1b9536ee5ee82e2ec0ba8948d8f8238488c3/semantic-commit-messages.md)
pull request titles. These are verified automatically during PR linting.

### üöß Handling Deprecated Code

When a piece of code is marked as deprecated, it means that it's not recommended for use and may be
removed in a future update. Here are the rules that are followed for deprecated code:

1. **Marking Deprecated Code**: JSDoc comments are used to mark deprecated code. Above the
   Deprecated code, we add a comment in the following format:

```javascript
/**
 * @deprecated DD.MM.YYYY - This will not be available 6 months after deprecation. Use `alternative` instead.
 */
```

2. **Time Frame**: Deprecated code will be kept for at least 6 months after deprecation. This means
   that if a piece of code is deprecated on 01.01.2021, it will be removed on 01.07.2021 at the
   earliest.

3. **Alternative Solutions**: Whenever possible, an alternative solution will be provided in the
   deprecation comment.
