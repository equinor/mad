## üë®‚Äçüíª Development

### ‚è±Ô∏è Getting started

This turborepo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as a package manager. Start by cloning the repository
and run

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

Install dependencies, run

```
pnpm install
```

You can build only the packages you work on, but if you want to build everything to start with, run

```
pnpm build:all
```

### üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Working on a package

Packages in the repository usually have some common scripts to make development easier. These are
labeled by the following keywords : `build`, `test`, `dev`, and `lint`.

The `dev` commands wrap package specific needs into a single command for development. Take for
example the [MAD Components](./packages/components/) package. Since any change in its code requires
a build for the [MAD Chronicles](./apps/chronicles/) app to refresh, we define the `dev` script in
the components package to build with the `watch` flag. A developer working on the component library
does not need to bother with these details, so running

```
pnpm dev:chronicles
pnpm dev:components
```

is all that is required.

This is how development on the packages is set up. With some exceptions, you can run any of these
scripts with

```
pnpm {keyword}:{package-alias}
```

Head into the project root [package.json](./package.json) for a full list of all commands.

### üôè Contributing to the repository

#### Branching

We use
[Trunk-based development](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development)
in this repository. Branching is done in and out of the `main` branch for each update.

#### Pull requests

Pull requests into main should as a rule of thumb ALWAYS contain a changeset (see:
[Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)). You create these by running

```
pnpm changeset
```

and follow the promts. This way, changelogs and version bumps are automatically handeled. Also note
that we use
[semantic](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716/raw/e75b1b9536ee5ee82e2ec0ba8948d8f8238488c3/semantic-commit-messages.md)
pull request titles. These are verified automatically during PR linting.
