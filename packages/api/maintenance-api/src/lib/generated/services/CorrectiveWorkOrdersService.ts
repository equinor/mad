    /**
     * Corrective Work order - Lookup
     * ### Overview
     * Lookup single Corrective Work order with related information
     *
     * ### Technical feedback
     * Technical feedback ensures a common and best practice maintenance based on the type of tag/equipment. It's mostly used by preventive work orders, but can in some cases be used in corrective work orders.
     * As part of work order execution, the technical feedback will need to be completed.
     *
     * The endpoint `/work-orders/technical-feedback-master-data` describes the business rules for when it's necessary to create a maintenance record based on the status (`feedbackStatusId`) and reason  (`feedbackReasonId`) found for the technical feedback.
     *
     * The `include-technical-feedback` query parameter for preventive and corrective work order lookup endpoints will return the technical feedback for each operation of the provided work order.
     *
     * If a technical feedback has `isDetailedFeedback: true`, it requires a very specific feedback type currently not supported by the Maintenance API.
     *
     * When executing a technical feedback item, the end-user will complete the steps described in `maintenanceActivityText` and end up with a result in the form of a status (`feedbackStatusId`) and a reason (`feedbackReasonId`). Compare the result with the business rules defined by `/work-orders/technical-feedback-master-data` and base the next step based on the value of `hasRequiredMaintenanceRecord`:
     *
     * * `hasRequiredMaintenanceRecord: true`: Create a new maintenance record for technical feedback using the `POST /maintenance-records/failure-reports` or `POST /maintenance-records/activity-reports` endpoints with the relatedWorkOrder properties in the request to specify the work order and technical feedback
     *
     * * `hasRequiredMaintenanceRecord: false` As no maintenance record is required, the technical feedback is completed using the endpoint `PATCH /work-order-operations/{operation-id}/technical-feedback/{feedback-id}`
     *
     * If you want to include the maintenance records of a technical feedback, one needs to apply both `include-technical-feedback=True`, and `include-maintenance-records=True`.
     *
     * ### Production Resources/Tool (PRT)
     * Production resources/tools (PRT) are used for materials, tools and equipment that are needed to carry out the task and are to be returned after use.
     *
     * In Equinor, this is normally added as part of maintenance program.
     * Maintenance API supports the following PRT resources:
     * - Attachments (through query parameter `include-attachments=true`)
     * - Measuring points (through query parameter `include-measuring-points=true`)
     * - URL references (through query parameter `include-url-references=true`)
     *
     * For more information see governing document [GL1624 Guidelines for the establishment of a preventive maintenance programme in SAP](https://docmap.equinor.com/Docmap/page/doc/dmDocIndex.html?DOCKEYID=533758).
     *
     * ### Important information
     * Properties areaId and area are deprecated as of 01.2021 in order to align with naming across Equinor system. Use locationId and location instead.
     *
     * ### Update release v1.0.0
     * Work order operation actualPercentageComplete now represents progress reported through technical feedback.
     * If the Work order operation is completed, the value of actualPercentageComplete will always be 100.
     *
     * ### Update release v1.1.0
     * If work-order-id exist, but is not a `correctiveWorkOrder`, the response is a HTTP 301 Moved Permanently with the url to the resource in the HTTP header Location.
     *
     * ### Update release v1.3.0
     * Introduced holdDeliveryOnshore and requiredDatetime properties for materials.
     *
     * ### Update release v1.4.0
     * Introduced property calculationKey for operations.
     *
     * ### Update release v1.5.0
     * Added createdDateTime for attachments.
     *
     * Added revisionId and revision to work order response (represents shutdown or campaign work).
     *
     * ### Update release v1.7.0
     * Added equipmentId and equipment to the response of tagsRelated.
     *
     * Adding sourceId to related maintenance records.
     *
     * ### Update release v1.8.0
     * Introduced property activeStatusIds for operations.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.12.0
     * Added new query parameter `include-technical-feedback`. It returns related technical feedback required to be completed as part of work order execution. Technical feedback is mostly used for preventive work orders, but can also be used for corrective work orders.
     *
     * Introduced property `detectionMethodGroupId` and `detectionMethodId` for technical feedback.
     *
     * ### Update release v1.15.0
     * Added new query parameter `include-measurements`.
     *
     * ### Update release v1.16.0
     * Added new query parameters `include-measuring-points`, `include-last-measurement` and `include-url-references`. `include-attachments` extended to also return PRT attachments of an operation.  `attachments` now include properties `documentType`, `documentNumber` and `documentTitle`.

     * @returns ProblemDetails Response for other HTTP status codes

    /**
     * Corrective Work order - Update status
     * ## Overview
     * Activate or deactivate status for Work order.
     *
     * Overview of how status are used can be found in Equinor's governing document [GL1561 - Work orders and notifications types](https://docmap.equinor.com/Docmap/page/doc/dmDocAll.html?DOCVIEW=FALSE?DOCKEYID=525791)
     *
     * To identify which status the work order currently has perform a request to: `work-orders/corrective-work-orders/{{work-order-id}}?include-status-details=true`
     *
     * ## Supported statuses
     * The endpoint supports most status activiation such as:
     *
     * - RDEX - Ready for execution
     * - STRT - Job started
     * - RDOP - Ready for operation
     * - TECO - Technical complete
     * - CLSD - Business close
     *
     * Deactivation is supported in most cases where there is no interdependency between statuses. For status with a statusOrder value, deactivation is not necessary (nor supported) as the business logic will handle the switch.
     *
     * The following statuses are not supported at the moment and will return a HTTP 405 response:
     *
     * - EXTR - Date extension required
     * - PERM - Work permit provided
     * - SJA - Safe job analysis required
     * - WP - Work Permit exist
     * - SJAR - Safe Job Analysis required
     * - SJAE - Safe Job Analysis exist
     * - PMSG - Purchasing Message
     * - MLTI - Multi discipline
     *
     * ### Update version 0.9.0
     * Support for releasing a work order by setting the REL status.
     *
     * Support for complete-outstanding-maintenance-records query parameter for TECO and CLSD statuses.
     *
     * ### Update version 1.1.0
     * Support for deactivating TECO status
     *
     * ### Update version 1.6.0
     * Support for ActivatedDateTime for TECO status. It is an optional parameter which allows to overwrite the default reference date for TECO. If no value is provided, the value will be set to current timestamp.
     *
     * Parameter complete-outstanding-maintenance-records set to true will close maintenance records which have a relationship to the work order via the `ObjectList`.
