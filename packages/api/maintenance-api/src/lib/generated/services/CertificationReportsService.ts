    /**
     * Certification report - Lookup
     * ### Overview
     * Lookup a single certification report.
     *
     * The certification report represents the results of PSV or lifting certification.
     *
     * For PSV certification, details are reported as measurements for 33 predefined measuring points.
     * For lifting certification, details are stored in attachment and possibly as characteristics on the tag/equipment.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.5.0
     * Added createdDateTime for attachments.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.6.0
     * Added `301` response.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.11.0
     * Added properties `createdById`,`createdBy` and `createdByEmail`.
     * `createdById` will always be have value in response. `createdBy` and `createdByEmail` will only have value in response if the `include-created-by-details` query parameter is `true`.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.16.0
     * `attachments` now include properties `documentType`, `documentNumber` and `documentTitle`.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.21.0
     * Added property `area` to tag details.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.24.0
     * `attachments` now include the property `documentCreatedDate`
     *
     * ### Update release 1.26.0
     * `tagDetails` object now includes the new field `maintenanceConceptId`
     *
     * ### Update release 1.27.0
     * Added `maintenanceRecordTypeId` to the response.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.28.0
     * Added ability to create text with advanced formatting. See the heading [Resource text](#section/Modelling-of-resources/Resource-text) in the description for more info. This feature is controlled by a
     * configuration switch, which will initially be disabled, and when appropriate, enabled.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.32.0
     * Added `changedDateTime` for attachments.
     *
     * Added properties `failureStartDateTime` and `failureEndDateTime` to response.
     *
     * @returns CertificationReport Success
     * @returns ProblemDetails Response for other HTTP status codes
     * @throws ApiError

     * Certification report - Attachment upload
     * Upload attachment for certification report

     * Limitations of Attachment upload endpoints:
     * - No support for parallel calls (uploading multiple attachments at once).
     * - Maximum file size is 60 MB. Files between 60.0MB - 99.9MB will give a 400 error. Files larger than 100MB will result in a `413 Request Entity Too Large' Error in HTML. This is due to constraints in the underlying system and is outside of our control.

     * ### Important information
     * If `documentTitle` is supplied, the title is added to all files that are sent
     * in the current request. If different titles are wanted for different files, they have to be sent in separately
     * (one file, one document title per request). When supplying a document-title, a new document will always be created for the attachment
     *
     * If documentTitle is supplied both as form-data and query parameter, the query parameter
     * will take precedence.
     *
     * If `document-id` is supplied, the attachment will be uploaded specifically to this document. `document-title` and `document-id` cannot be supplied together.
