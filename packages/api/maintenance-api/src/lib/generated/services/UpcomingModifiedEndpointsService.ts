     * Measuring points - Search
     * ### Overview
     * Search measuring points.
     *
     * ### Filter: by-plant
     * Search measuring points based on plant and one other property of the measuring point.
     * Parameters:
     * - plant-id
     *
     * At least one of the following parameters is required:
     *
     * - `tag-prefix`
     * - `measuring-position`
     * - `quantitative-characteristic`
     * - `qualitative-code-group`
     * - `measuring-point-name`
     * - `characteristic-value-any-of`
     *
     * ### Examples
     * `/measuring-points?filter=by-plant&plant-id=1180&tag-prefix=18HV10&api-version=v1`
     * `/measuring-points?filter=by-plant&plant-id=1102&quantitative-characteristic=SURFACE_MAINTEANC&api-version=v1`
     *
     * `/measuring-points?filter=by-plant&plant-id=1180&tag-prefix=18HV10&position=VALVE%20STATUS&include-last-measurement=true&api-version=v1`
     *
     *
     * When using the `characteristic-value-any-of` it is important to URI Encode the input data especially when there are special characters as part of the input:
     *
     * `/measuring-points?characteristic-value-any-of=%3D17445%2F9818,%3D17433/6333&class-id=L_PART&characteristic-id=L_E3DREF&plant-id=1201&api-version=v1`
     *
     * ### Update release 1.10.0
     * Added property `maintenanceRecordId` to measurements.
     *
     * Added `include-characteristics` and `include-characteristics-without-value` query parameter.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.15.0
     * Added `workOrderId` to response.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.20.0
     * Edited the response structure to support pagination. Use the parameters `page` and `per-page` in the parameters to edit wanted response.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.21.0
     * Measuring points for equipment are now included in searches based on `plant-id`.
     * Measuring points for equipment now include the `tagId` and `tagPlantId` of the tag the equipment is installed on.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.22.0
     * To limit the response data for filter `by-plant`, at least one of the additional parameters must be provided.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.30.0
     * Added `characteristic-value-any-of`, `class-id` and `characteristic-id` query parameters.
     * Can be used to search for measuring points based on values of a characteristic.
     *
     * ### Update future release
     * Added `include-measurement-text` query parameter to include measurement text in the response.
     *
     * @returns MeasuringPoint Success
     * @returns ProblemDetails Response for other HTTP status codes
     * @throws ApiError

    /**
     * Work orders - Optimized for query
     * ### Overview
     * Query work orders for potentially complicated patterns where speed is of the essence.
     *
     * `planning-plants` is the only mandatory fields, but clients should normally provide at least one more query criteria.
     *
     * A normal use case would be to first provide an initial query criteria based on user input. Then allow the end-users based on the resulting data select unwanted results based on specific attributes. The unwanted results should then be added to the exclusion list (for example `keywords-not` or `work-centers-not)` and the API call repeated.
     *
     * `max-results` have a default value of 1000 and is necessary to provide a quick response.
     *
     * The multi-line `text` property is not included by default, but can included by setting `include-text=true` in the request. This will influence performance significantly.
     *
     * Pagination is supported for this endpoint by setting values for `page` and `per-page`. If these parameteres are omitted, the result will be returned without pagination.
     *
     * ### Response
     * The response schema has been optimized for speed, enabling the retrieval of work orders only from the past three years.
     *
     * ### Examples
     * `/work-orders-optimized-for-query?api-version=v1&planning-plants=1100,1101,1102&tags-all-of=10B9` - Return work orders where tag is 10B9
     *
     * `/work-orders-optimized-for-query?api-version=v1&planning-plants=1100,1101,1102&tags-all-of=AA15*&tags-not=AA15002` - Return work orders where tag has pattern `AA15*` but is not AA15002
     *
     * `/work-orders-optimized-for-query?api-version=v1&planning-plants=1100,1101,1102&keywords-all-of=heli,male` - Return work orders where the title contains both `heli` and `male`
     *
     * `/work-orders-optimized-for-query?api-version=v1&planning-plants=1100,1101,1102&status-any-of=PREP,RDEX&created-after-date=2021-06-01` - Return work orders with status PREP or RDEX and created after a certain date
     *
     * ### Update release 1.5.0
     * Added revisionId to work order response (represents shutdown or campaign work).
     *
     * ### Update release 1.12.0
     * Added query parameter `include-maintenance-record`.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.16.0
     * Added property `workCenterId` to `maintenanceRecords.failureReports`
     *
     * ### Update release 1.29.0
     * Added properties `revision` and `changedDatetime`.
     *
     * Allow searching by `changedOnDay` when `is-open` is set. Search by using the new query parameters `changed-after-date` and `changed-before-date`.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.31.0
     * Added list of supported statuses for `status-all-of`, `status-any-of` and `status-not` query parameters. Status `REL` is now supported.
     *
     * Added property `hasStatusREL` to the response.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.35.0
     * Added support for optional pagination.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.37.0
     * Added query parameter `work-order-ids-any-of` & add support for SWNG in `status-all-of`, `status-any-of` and `status-not` query parameters.
     *
     * Deprecated query parameter `max-results` as the same functionality can be achieved with `per-page`.
     *
     * Added properties `tag`, `requiredEndDate`, `hseCritical` & `productionCritical`.
     *
     * Added query parameter `include-status-details` and the object `statuses`
     *
     * ### Upcoming future release
     * Added `overheadMaintenanceWorkOrders` to `work-order-types` query parameter.
     *
     * @returns WorkOrderOptimizedForQuery Success
     * @returns ProblemDetails Response for other HTTP status codes
     * @throws ApiError
