     * Document - Search
     * ### Overview
     * Search documents and include related information such as characteristics, materials, equipment and attachments.
     *
     *
     * The client must in the request provide at least one of the following search parameters:
     * * `document-type-any-of`
     * * `document-number-any-of`
     * * `characteristic-value-any-of`
     *
     * **N.B** The link in the attachment object is in the first iteration always routed via the equipment attachment endpoint.
     * In a future release we will implement a general endpoint `documents/attachment/{attachment-id}` for downloading attachments which will be displayed here.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.31.0
     * Added `include-inventory-count` query parameter to include `equipmentInventoryCount` and `materialInventoryCount` property in the response.
     *
     * Added support for including more business objects: `include-tags`, `include-measuring-points` and `include-maintenance-records`.
     *
     * ### Update in upcoming release
     * Added `include-url-references` query parameter to include URL references in the response.
     *
     * @returns Document Success
     * @returns ProblemDetails Response for other HTTP status codes
     * @throws ApiError
