    /**
     * Preventive Work order - Lookup
     * ### Overview
     * Lookup single Preventive Work order with related information.
     *
     * ### Technical feedback
     * Technical feedback ensures a common and best practice maintenance based on the type of tag/equipment. It's mostly used by preventive work orders, but can in some cases be used in corrective work orders.
     * As part of work order execution, the technical feedback items will need to be completed.
     *
     * The endpoint `/work-orders/technical-feedback-master-data` describes the business rules for when it's necessary to create a maintenance record based on the status(`feedbackStatusId`) and reason(`feedbackReasonId`) found for the technical feedback.
     *
     * The `include-technical-feedback` query parameter for preventive and corrective work order lookup endpoints will return the technical feedback for each operation of the provided work order.
     *
     * If a technical feedback has `isDetailedFeedback: true`, it requires a very specific feedback type currently not supported by the Maintenance API.
     *
     * When executing a technical feedback item, the end-user will complete the steps described in `maintenanceActivityText` and end up with a result in the form of a status(`feedbackStatusId`) and a reason(`feedbackReasonId`). Compare the result with the business rules defined by `/work-orders/technical-feedback-master-data`:
     *
     * * `hasRequiredMaintenanceRecord: true`: Create a new maintenance record for technical feedback using the `POST /maintenance-records/failure-reports` or `POST /maintenance-records/activity-reports` endpoints with the relatedWorkOrder properties in the request to specify the work order and technical feedback
     *
     * * `hasRequiredMaintenanceRecord: true` As no maintenance record is required, the technical feedback is completed using the endpoint `PATCH /work-order-operations/{operation-id}/technical-feedback/{feedback-id}`
     *
     * If you want to include the maintenance records of a technical feedback, one needs to apply both `include-technical-feedback=True`, and `include-maintenance-records=True`.
     *
     * ### Production Resources/Tool (PRT)
     * Production resources/tools (PRT) are used for materials, tools and equipment that are needed to carry out the task and are to be returned after use.
     *
     * In Equinor, this is normally added as part of maintenance program.
     * Maintenance API supports the following PRT resources:
     * - Attachments (through query parameter `include-attachments=true`)
     * - Measuring points (through query parameter `include-measuring-points=true`)
     * - URL references (through query parameter `include-url-references=true`)
     *
     * For more information see governing document [GL1624 Guidelines for the establishment of a preventive maintenance programme in SAP](https://docmap.equinor.com/Docmap/page/doc/dmDocIndex.html?DOCKEYID=533758).
     *
     * ### Update release 1.0.0
     * Work order operation actualPercentageComplete now represents progress reported through technical feedback.
     * If the Work order operation is completed, the value of actualPercentageComplete will always be 100.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.1.0
     * If work-order-id exist, but is not a `preventiveWorkOrder`, the response is a HTTP 301 Moved Permanently with the url to the resource in the HTTP header Location.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.3.0
     * Introduced holdDeliveryOnshore and requiredDatetime properties for materials.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.4.0
     * Introduced property calculationKey for operations.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.5.0
     * Added createdDateTime for attachments.
     *
     * Added revisionId and revision to work order response (represents shutdown or campaign work).
     *
     * ### Update release 1.7.0
     * Added equipmentId and equipment to the response of tagsRelated.
     *
     * Added sourceId to related maintenance records.
     *
     * Added isActive property for maintenance plan details.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.8.0

     *
     * ### Update release 1.11.0
     * Added the following properties:
     *
     * * personResponsibleId and personResponsibleEmail
     * * isProductionCritical and isHSECritical
     * * workCenter
     * * plannerGroup
     *
     * ### Update release 1.12.0
     * Added new query parameter `include-technical-feedback`. It returns related technical feedback required to be completed as part of work order execution.
     *
     * Introduced property `detectionMethodGroupId` and `detectionMethodId` for technical feedback.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.15.0
     * Added new query parameter `include-measurements`
     *
     * ### Update release 1.16.0
     * Added new query parameters `include-measuring-points`, `include-last-measurement` and `include-url-references`. `include-attachments` extended to also return PRT attachments of an operation.  `attachments` now include properties `documentType`, `documentNumber` and `documentTitle`.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.19.0
     * Added properties `systemCondition` and `isExcludedFromWorkOrderPlan` for operations.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.21.0
     * Added property `area` to tag details.
     *
     * Added ability to create text with advanced formatting. See the heading [Resource text](#section/Modelling-of-resources/Resource-text) in the description for more info. This feature is controlled by a
     * configuration switch, which will initially be disabled, and when appropriate, enabled.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.22.0
     * Added new query parameter `include-service-operations`. Operations of type Service - PM03 previously available in the `operations` have been moved to `serviceOperations`.

     *
     * ### Update release 1.24.0

     *
     * Split parts of `location` on `operations.materials` into `finalLocation` and `temporaryLocation` in the response.
     *
     * Added `agreement` & `agreementItem` on `serviceOperations` and `grossPrice`, `netValue` & `currency` on `services`.
     *
     * ### Update in an upcoming release
     * Added new properties `goodsRecipientId`, `price`, `priceCurrency`, `unloadingPoint`, and `purchasingGroup` to `materials`.
