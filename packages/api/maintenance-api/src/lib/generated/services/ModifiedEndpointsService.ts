     * Equipment - Search
     * ### Overview
     * Search for equipment and include related maintenance information.
     *
     * The endpoint has several include query parameters which allows a client to retrieve only the information which is relevant for their use case.
     *
     * The client must in the request provide at least one of the following search parameters:
     * * `equipment-id-any-of`
     * * `serial-number-any-of`
     * * `vendor-part-number-any-of`
     * * `material-id-any-of`
     * * `characteristic-value-any-of`
     * * `equipment-any-of`
     * * `technical-id-any-of`
     *
     * These parameters allow a comma-separated list of entries.
     *
     * If more than one of these parameters are supplied in the same request, the equipment in the response will need to fulfill all parameters (ie. operator AND is used between the parameter).
     *
     * Query parameters `include-only-open-maintenance-records` and `include-only-open-work-orders` have a recommended value of `true` in order to improve performance (default value `false`).
     *
     * ### Important information
     * For warehouse and logistics data of an equipment, use SCM Logistics API.
     *
     * ### Example usage
     * `/equipment?serial-number-any-of=4500695422-20-003,4500695422-20-004&include-maintenance-records=true&include-maintenance-record-types=failure-report&include-only-open-maintenance-records=true&include-work-orders=true&include-work-order-types=preventiveWorkOrders,subseaWorkOrders&include-only-open-work-orders=true&include-characteristics=true&api-version=v1` - Search equipment based on serialNumber with characteritics. Include open failure reports where the equipment is used as main reference. Include open subsea work orders and open preventive work orders where the equipment is either a material component or the main reference (`equipmentId` at work order header level).
     *
     * When using the `characteristic-value-any-of` it is important to URI Encode the input data especially when there are special characters as part of the input:
     *
     * `/equipment?characteristic-value-any-of=%3D17445%2F9818,%3D17433/6333&class-id=L_PART&characteristic-id=L_E3DREF&plant-id=1201&api-version=v1`
     *
     * ### Update release 1.4.0
     * `include-work-orders` now include work orders where the `equipmentId` is the main reference (`equipmentId` at work order header level).
     *
     * ### Update release 1.5.0
     * Fixed known limitation for `include-work-orders` and `include-only-open-work-orders=false`.
     *
     * Bugfix for include-work-orders related to deleted equipment reservations.
     *
     * Added revisionId and revision to related work orders (represents shutdown or campaign work).
     *
     * ### Update release 1.6.0
     * For `include-work-orders`, add information on the relationship between the equipment and the work order (for example the id of the reservation)
     *
     * ### Update release 1.7.0
     * Added property parentEquipmentId.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.8.0

    /**
     * Preventive Work order - Lookup
     * ### Overview
     * Lookup single Preventive Work order with related information.
     *
     * ### Technical feedback
     * Technical feedback ensures a common and best practice maintenance based on the type of tag/equipment. It's mostly used by preventive work orders, but can in some cases be used in corrective work orders.
     * As part of work order execution, the technical feedback items will need to be completed.
     *
     * The endpoint `/work-orders/technical-feedback-master-data` describes the business rules for when it's necessary to create a maintenance record based on the status(`feedbackStatusId`) and reason(`feedbackReasonId`) found for the technical feedback.
     *
     * The `include-technical-feedback` query parameter for preventive and corrective work order lookup endpoints will return the technical feedback for each operation of the provided work order.
     *
     * If a technical feedback has `isDetailedFeedback: true`, it requires a very specific feedback type currently not supported by the Maintenance API.
     *
     * When executing a technical feedback item, the end-user will complete the steps described in `maintenanceActivityText` and end up with a result in the form of a status(`feedbackStatusId`) and a reason(`feedbackReasonId`). Compare the result with the business rules defined by `/work-orders/technical-feedback-master-data`:
     *
     * * `hasRequiredMaintenanceRecord: true`: Create a new maintenance record for technical feedback using the `POST /maintenance-records/failure-reports` or `POST /maintenance-records/activity-reports` endpoints with the relatedWorkOrder properties in the request to specify the work order and technical feedback
     *
     * * `hasRequiredMaintenanceRecord: true` As no maintenance record is required, the technical feedback is completed using the endpoint `PATCH /work-order-operations/{operation-id}/technical-feedback/{feedback-id}`
     *
     * If you want to include the maintenance records of a technical feedback, one needs to apply both `include-technical-feedback=True`, and `include-maintenance-records=True`.
     *
     * ### Production Resources/Tool (PRT)
     * Production resources/tools (PRT) are used for materials, tools and equipment that are needed to carry out the task and are to be returned after use.
     *
     * In Equinor, this is normally added as part of maintenance program.
     * Maintenance API supports the following PRT resources:
     * - Attachments (through query parameter `include-attachments=true`)
     * - Measuring points (through query parameter `include-measuring-points=true`)
     * - URL references (through query parameter `include-url-references=true`)
     *
     * For more information see governing document [GL1624 Guidelines for the establishment of a preventive maintenance programme in SAP](https://docmap.equinor.com/Docmap/page/doc/dmDocIndex.html?DOCKEYID=533758).
     *
     * ### Update release 1.0.0

    /**
     * Work orders - Search
     * ### Overview
     * Search for Work orders regardless of type through predefined filters.
     * Each filter has a defined action and a set of parameters as described below.
     *
     * ### Response
     * The response can include most of the details for each work order.
     * If additional data is needed, it can be retrieved by using the endpoint represented in the `_links.self` property.
     *
     *
     * ### Filter: recently-changed
     * Find Work orders which have been recently changed (created or updated) for a given plant. Normally, clients will provide the parameters `changed-since-datetime` and `plant-id` to return any changed Work order from `changed-since-datetime` to now. It is also possible to add `before-datetime` query parameter - the endpoint will then return any work order changed between `changed-since-datetime` and `before-datetime`.
     *
     * Parameters:
     * - `plant-id`
     * - `changed-since-datetime`
     * - `before-datetime` (optional)
     *
     * ### Filter: before-basic-end-date
     * Find open Work orders before the `basic-end-date`. `basic-end-date` should be a date in the future so that already finished work orders will not be presented.
     *
     * Parameters:
     * - `plant-id`
     * - `basic-end-date`
     * - `location-id` (optional)
     *
     * ### Filter: by-external-partner-work-order-id
     * Find Work orders for a 'work-order-id' in an external partner system. Note: In theory, different external systems could have the same `external-partner-id` but this is very unlikely. Clients are recommended to filter the response based on the plants they are interested in to avoid any issues.
     *
     * Parameters:
     * - `external-partner-work-order-id`
     *
     * ### Filter: by-cost-network
     * Find Work orders based on Cost Network Id.
     *
     * Parameters:
     * - `cost-network-id`
     * - `plant-id` (optional)
     *
     * ### Filter: by-cost-wbs
     * Find Work orders based on Cost WBS Id.
     *
     * Parameters:
     * - `cost-wbs-id`
     * - `plant-id` (optional)
     *
     * ### Filter: by-work-center-id
     * Find Work orders based on their `workCenterId`.
     *
     * Parameters:
     * - `work-center-id-any-of`
     * - `plant-id` (optional)
     *
     * ### Filter: by-work-order-id
     * Find Work orders based on their `workOrderId`.
     *
     * Parameters:
     * - `work-order-ids-any-of`
     * - `plant-id` (optional)
     *
     * ### Update release 0.11.0
     * Work order operation actualPercentageComplete now represents progress reported through technical feedback.
     * If the Work order operation is completed, the value of actualPercentageComplete will always be 100.
     *
     * Filter by-external-partner-work-order-id added.
     * ### Update release 1.3.0
     * Bugfix related to plantId source.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.4.0
     * Introduced property calculationKey for operations.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.5.0
     * Added revisionId and revision to work order response (represents shutdown or campaign work).
     *
     * ### Update release 1.12.0
     * Improved performance of endpoint.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.19.0
     * Added properties `systemCondition` and `isExcludedFromWorkOrderPlan` for operations.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.21.0
     * Added ability to update text with advanced formatting. See the heading [Resource text](#section/Modelling-of-resources/Resource-text) in the description for more info. This feature is controlled by a
     * configuration switch, which will initially be disabled, and when appropriate, enabled.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.24.0
     * Added filter `by-cost-wbs`, with required parameter `cost-wbs-id`. Can be used in combination with the optional parameter `plant-id`
     * This filter only includes work orders where the WBS is represented on the work order level. It does not include work orders where WBS is only represented in the settlement rules.
     *
     * Added filter `by-cost-network`, with required parameter `cost-network-id`. Can be used in combination with the optional parameter `plant-id`
     *
     * Added property `cmrIndicator` to the top level objects in the response.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.27.0
     * Work orders now include the property `isOpen`
     *
     * ### Update release 1.30.0
     * Modified GET work order to fetch data from Maintenance plant from the sap field `swerk`.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.31.0
     * Fixed enum values for `schedulingStartConstraintId` and `schedulingFinishConstraintId`
     *
     * ### Update release 1.35.0
     * Added filter `by-work-center-id` with the required parameter `work-center-id-any-of`. Can optionally be combined with the parameter `plant-id`
     *
     * Added filter `by-work-order-id` with the required parameter `work-order-ids-any-of`. Can optionally be combined with the parameter `plant-id`
     *
     * Added option to not include operations for the Work Orders by setting the optional parameter `include-operations` to `false` (default is `true`). This can improve performance for the endpoint.
     *
     * Added property `requiredEndDate` to the top level objects in the response.
     *
     * Added property `confirmationId` to `operations`
     *
     * @returns WorkOrderWithOperationList Success
     * @returns ProblemDetails Response for other HTTP status codes
     * @throws ApiError

    /**
     * Work orders - Optimized for query
     * ### Overview
     * Query work orders for potentially complicated patterns where speed is of the essence.
     *
     * `planning-plants` is the only mandatory fields, but clients should normally provide at least one more query criteria.
     *
     * A normal use case would be to first provide an initial query criteria based on user input. Then allow the end-users based on the resulting data select unwanted results based on specific attributes. The unwanted results should then be added to the exclusion list (for example `keywords-not` or `work-centers-not)` and the API call repeated.
     *
     * `max-results` have a default value of 1000 and is necessary to provide a quick response.
     *
     * The multi-line `text` property is not included by default, but can included by setting `include-text=true` in the request. This will influence performance significantly.
     *
     * Pagination is supported for this endpoint by setting values for `page` and `per-page`. If these parameteres are omitted, the result will be returned without pagination.
     *
     * ### Response
     * The response schema differs slightly from the other work order endpoints as a result of the optimization for speed.
     *
     * ### Examples
     * `/work-orders-optimized-for-query?api-version=v1&planning-plants=1100,1101,1102&tags-all-of=10B9` - Return work orders where tag is 10B9
     *
     * `/work-orders-optimized-for-query?api-version=v1&planning-plants=1100,1101,1102&tags-all-of=AA15*&tags-not=AA15002` - Return work orders where tag has pattern `AA15*` but is not AA15002
     *
     * `/work-orders-optimized-for-query?api-version=v1&planning-plants=1100,1101,1102&keywords-all-of=heli,male` - Return work orders where the title contains both `heli` and `male`
     *
     * `/work-orders-optimized-for-query?api-version=v1&planning-plants=1100,1101,1102&status-any-of=PREP,RDEX&created-after-date=2021-06-01` - Return work orders with status PREP or RDEX and created after a certain date
     *
     * ### Update release 1.5.0
     * Added revisionId to work order response (represents shutdown or campaign work).
     *
     * ### Update release 1.12.0
     * Added query parameter `include-maintenance-record`.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.16.0
     * Added property `workCenterId` to `maintenanceRecords.failureReports`
     *
     * ### Update release 1.29.0
     * Added properties `revision` and `changedDatetime`.
     *
     * Allow searching by `changedOnDay` when `is-open` is set. Search by using the new query parameters `changed-after-date` and `changed-before-date`.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.31.0
     * Added list of supported statuses for `status-all-of`, `status-any-of` and `status-not` query parameters. Status `REL` is now supported.
     *
     * Added property `hasStatusREL` to the response.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.35.0
     * Added optional pagination support.
