     * Corrective Work order - Lookup
     * ### Overview
     * Lookup single Corrective Work order with related information
     *
     * ### Technical feedback
     * Technical feedback ensures a common and best practice maintenance based on the type of tag/equipment. It's mostly used by preventive work orders, but can in some cases be used in corrective work orders.
     * As part of work order execution, the technical feedback will need to be completed.
     *
     * The endpoint `/work-orders/technical-feedback-master-data` describes the business rules for when it's necessary to create a maintenance record based on the status (`feedbackStatusId`) and reason  (`feedbackReasonId`) found for the technical feedback.
     *
     * The `include-technical-feedback` query parameter for preventive and corrective work order lookup endpoints will return the technical feedback for each operation of the provided work order.
     *
     * If a technical feedback has `isDetailedFeedback: true`, it requires a very specific feedback type currently not supported by the Maintenance API.
     *
     * When executing a technical feedback item, the end-user will complete the steps described in `maintenanceActivityText` and end up with a result in the form of a status (`feedbackStatusId`) and a reason (`feedbackReasonId`). Compare the result with the business rules defined by `/work-orders/technical-feedback-master-data` and base the next step based on the value of `hasRequiredMaintenanceRecord`:
     *
     * * `hasRequiredMaintenanceRecord: true`: Create a new maintenance record for technical feedback using the `POST /maintenance-records/failure-reports` or `POST /maintenance-records/activity-reports` endpoints with the relatedWorkOrder properties in the request to specify the work order and technical feedback
     *
     * * `hasRequiredMaintenanceRecord: false` As no maintenance record is required, the technical feedback is completed using the endpoint `PATCH /work-order-operations/{operation-id}/technical-feedback/{feedback-id}`
     *
     * If you want to include the maintenance records of a technical feedback, one needs to apply both `include-technical-feedback=True`, and `include-maintenance-records=True`.
     *
     * ### Production Resources/Tool (PRT)
     * Production resources/tools (PRT) are used for materials, tools and equipment that are needed to carry out the task and are to be returned after use.
     *
     * In Equinor, this is normally added as part of maintenance program.
     * Maintenance API supports the following PRT resources:
     * - Attachments (through query parameter `include-attachments=true`)
     * - Measuring points (through query parameter `include-measuring-points=true`)
     * - URL references (through query parameter `include-url-references=true`)
     *
     * For more information see governing document [GL1624 Guidelines for the establishment of a preventive maintenance programme in SAP](https://docmap.equinor.com/Docmap/page/doc/dmDocIndex.html?DOCKEYID=533758).
     *
     * ### Update release v1.0.0
     * Work order operation actualPercentageComplete now represents progress reported through technical feedback.
     * If the Work order operation is completed, the value of actualPercentageComplete will always be 100.
     *
     * ### Update release v1.1.0
     * If work-order-id exist, but is not a `correctiveWorkOrder`, the response is a HTTP 301 Moved Permanently with the url to the resource in the HTTP header Location.

     *
     * Introduced property `detectionMethodGroupId` and `detectionMethodId` for technical feedback.
     *
     * ### Update release v1.15.0
     * Added new query parameter `include-measurements`.
     *
     * ### Update release v1.16.0

    /**
     * Work orders - Optimized for query
     * ### Overview
     * Query work orders for potentially complicated patterns where speed is of the essence.
     *
     * `planning-plants` is the only mandatory fields, but clients should normally provide at least one more query criteria.
     *
     * A normal use case would be to first provide an initial query criteria based on user input. Then allow the end-users based on the resulting data select unwanted results based on specific attributes. The unwanted results should then be added to the exclusion list (for example `keywords-not` or `work-centers-not)` and the API call repeated.
     *
     * `max-results` have a default value of 1000 and is necessary to provide a quick response.
     *
     * The multi-line `text` property is not included by default, but can included by setting `include-text=true` in the request. This will influence performance significantly.
     *
     * ### Response
     * The response schema differs slightly from the other work order endpoints as a result of the optimization for speed.
     *
     * ### Examples
     * `/work-orders-optimized-for-query?api-version=v1&planning-plants=1100,1101,1102&tags-all-of=10B9` - Return work orders where tag is 10B9
     *
     * `/work-orders-optimized-for-query?api-version=v1&planning-plants=1100,1101,1102&tags-all-of=AA15*&tags-not=AA15002` - Return work orders where tag has pattern `AA15*` but is not AA15002
     *
     * `/work-orders-optimized-for-query?api-version=v1&planning-plants=1100,1101,1102&keywords-all-of=heli,male` - Return work orders where the title contains both `heli` and `male`
     *
     * `/work-orders-optimized-for-query?api-version=v1&planning-plants=1100,1101,1102&status-any-of=PREP,RDEX&created-after-date=2021-06-01` - Return work orders with status PREP or RDEX and created after a certain date
     *
     * ### Update release v1.5.0
     * Added revisionId to work order response (represents shutdown or campaign work).
     *
     * ### Update release v1.12.0
     * Added query parameter `include-maintenance-record`.
     *
     * ### Update release v1.16.0
     * Added property `workCenterId` to `maintenanceRecords.failureReports`

    /**
     * Failure report - Update
     * ## Overview
     * Update key fields of a failure report.
     *
     * The following endpoints can be used to find possible values for input:
     * 1. `workCenterId` - [/plants/{plant-id}?include-work-centers](#operation/LookupPlant)
     * 1. `plannerGroupId` - [/plants/{plant-id}?include-planner-groups=true](#operation/LookupPlant)
     * 1. `locationId` - [/plants/{plant-id}?include-locations=true](#operation/LookupPlant)
     * 1. `detectionMethodId`, `failureMechanismId`, `failureModeId` - [/plants/{plant-id}/tags/{tag-id}?include-catalog-profile-details=true](#operation/LookupTag) or [/equipment/{equipment-id}?include-catalog-profile-details=true](#operation/LookupEquipment)
     * 1. `codingId` - [/catalogs/{catalog-id}/code-groups](#operation/SearchCodeGroup)
     *
     *
     * ## Important information
     * To avoid accidentally overwriting the multi-line text property, the endpoint will reject any requests with an empty text property.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.0.0
     * Added possibility to update plannerGroupId.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.1.0
     * Added hasUnsafeFailureMode and unsafeFailureModeStatus properties to response according to business process requirement `R-12137 - Give immediate warning of unsafe failure modes`.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.3.0
     * Added `priorityId` to response.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.4.0
     * Added `workCenter` and `equipment` to response. Fields include descriptions of workCenterId and equipmentId
     *
     * ### Update release 1.28.0
     * Added ability to create text with advanced formatting. See the heading [Resource text](#section/Modelling-of-resources/Resource-text) in the description for more info. This feature is controlled by a
     * configuration switch, which will initially be disabled, and when appropriate, enabled.
     *
     * Added properties `codingGroupId` and `codingId`.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.29.0
     * Deprecated update of the property `failureImpactId`. See [Deprecation](#section/Deprecation/Deprecation-policy) for more information.
     *
     * @returns FailureReportBasic Success, the failure report has been updated
