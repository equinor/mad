     * Equipment - Lookup
     * ### Overview
     * Lookup a single equipment with related maintenance information.
     *
     * The endpoint has several include query parameters which allows a client to retrieve only the information which is relevant for their use case.

    /**
     * Corrective Work order - Update
     * ### Overview
     * Update a Corrective Work Order.
     *
     * Supports:
     * - Append and replace text
     * - Update workCenterId and workCenterPlantId
     * - Update tagId and tagPlantId
     * - Update basicStartDateTime and basicEndDateTime
     * - Update sortField
     * - Update title
     * - Update plannerGroupId
     * - Update revisionId (Use `/plants/{plant-id}?include-revisions=true&api-version=v1` to get a list of possible values)
     * - Update locationId (Use `/plants/{plant-id}?include-locations=true&api-version=v1` to get a list of possible values)
     * - Update systemId (Use `/plants/{plant-id}?include-systems=true&api-version=v1` to get a list of possible values)
     * - Update costs
     * - Update costWBSId and additionalCostWBSId
     * - Update priorityId
     *
     *
     * ### Important information - costWBSId and additionalCostWBSId
     * It's generally recommended that the values of `costWBSId` and `additionalCostWBSId` match.
     * When the work order is released (by setting status `REL`), there is Equinor business logic check to see if they match.
     * If the work order is released through Maintenance API, different values for costWBSId and additionalCostWBSId will result in an error.
     * If the work order is released directly in the ERP system, the user will receive a warning and can choose to continue.
     *
     * Updating of `costWBSId` will trigger a new determination of the settlement rule in the ERP system. If a settlemet rule already exists, the updating of `costWBSId` will automatically update the settlement rule. Hence the `costWBSId` and settlement rule are allways aligned.
     *
     *
     * ### Important information - Text
     * Append to text follows requirement `I-103209 - Notation in long text field - Upstream offshore`.
     *
     * Newest information in text is added above existing information and is automatically signed with date and full name of logged on user.
     *
     * ***When Advanced ERP text is enabled, information is not automatically signed and has to be sent with the input when using append***
     *
     * ### Important information - priorityId
     * `priorityId` can only be updated if the Corrective Work Order has a different priority than the FailureReport connected to this workorder.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.0.0
     * Added additional properties to update
     *
     * ### Update release 1.4.0
     * Adjusted logic for append text to work order. Newest information in text is now added above existing information.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.6.0
     * Added possibility for update of sortField and revisionId.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.7.0
     * Added possibility for update of locationId and systemId.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.18.0
     * Added possibility for update of `title` and `plannerGroupId`.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.21.0
     * Added possibility for update of `costs`.
     *
     * Added ability to update text with advanced formatting. See the heading [Resource text](#section/Modelling-of-resources/Resource-text) in the description for more info. This feature is controlled by a
     * configuration switch, which will initially be disabled, and when appropriate, enabled.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.29.0
     * Added possibility for update of `costWBSId` and `additionalCostWBSId`.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.31.0
     * Added possibility for update of `priorityId`.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.32.0
     *
     * Updating of `costWBSId` from now on triggers the determination/updating of the settlement rule.

    /**
     * Corrective Work order - Create
     * ### Overview
     * Create new Corrective Work order based on a supplied failure report.
     *
     * It's possible to supply operations in the create operation. If no operations are passed, a default operation will be created automatically.
     *
     * To lookup the created corrective work order use endpoint `/work-orders/corrective-work-orders/{work-order-id}`
     *
     * ### Important information
     *
     * Up until release 1.32.0, we have enabled creating operations with `operationId` `0010` through the API, allowing the user to customize this operation during creation.
     *
     * Starting from release 1.32.0, the API logic for creating operations has been aligned with the new logic enforced by the SAP backend system. The new logic adds operations from the task list of any failure report that the work order is created from.
     *
     * As a result, creating an operation with a reserved `operationId` is no longer allowed.
     * This always affects operations with `operationId` equal to `0010`, but can also apply to other operations.
     *
     * To see which operations are already reserved, use `/maintenance-api/maintenance-records/failure-reports/{record-id}&include-task-list=true`
     *
     * ### Update release 1.1.0
     * Added externalPartnerWorkOrderId property to be used as reference to work order in external partner system.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.5.0
     * Added revisionId and revision to work order response (represents shutdown or campaign work).
     *
     * ### Update release 1.6.0
     * Added sortField and revisionId to create request. Use `/plants/{plant-id}?include-revisions=true&api-version=v1` to get a list of possible values for `revisionId`.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.8.0
     * Added support for calculation key on operation level. It determines the relationship between plannedWorkDuration, plannedWorkHours, and capacityCount.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.21.0
     * Add property `IsExcludedFromWorkOrderPlan` to operations model.
     *
     * Added ability to create text with advanced formatting. See the heading [Resource text](#section/Modelling-of-resources/Resource-text) in the description for more info. This feature is controlled by a
     * configuration switch, which will initially be disabled, and when appropriate, enabled.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.24.0
     * Added property `cmrIndicator` in the response.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.27.0
     * Work orders now include the property 'isOpen'
     *
     * ### Update release 1.31.0
     * Fixed enum values for `schedulingStartConstraintId` and `schedulingFinishConstraintId`
     *
     * ### Update release 1.32.0
     * Restriction to create a work order with operationId `0010` and other reserved operationIds.

     *
     * ### Update 1.14.0
     * Added support for filter `by-tag-ids` with accompanying parameter `tag-ids-any-of`
     * Filter is not required and defaults to `by-tag-prefix` to keep backwards compatibility.
     *
     * Added options to include more data using the same data model as on `Tag - Lookup`, but all includes are defaulted
     * to false.
     *
     * `by-tag-prefix` filter now supports wildcards (`*`) in the tag prefix
     *
     * Edited the response structure to support pagination if filter `by-tag-prefix` is set. Use the parameters `page` and `per-page` in the parameters to edit wanted response.
     *
     * ### Update release 1.15.0
     * Added `include-linear-data` and `include-status-details` query parameters.
     *
     * Added properties `tagCategoryId`, `activeStatusIds`, `startUpDate` and `endOfUseDate`.
