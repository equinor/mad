# React Native Mad Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

This library adds a camera component that automatically recognizes text in real-time. The text is
highlighted on the screen with a boundary box and is selectable by clicking the screen. This is
useful for tasks such as scanning tags on platforms and other facilities.

## üñåÔ∏è How to use

This library exports a component called `OCRCamera` that you can import into your project. The code
below shows how it can be used.

```tsx
export const MyComponent = () => {
    const onScanResult = (tag: string) => {
        // do someting here
    };

    const onScanCancel = () => {
        // do something here
    };

    return (
        <>
            <OCRCamera onSelectTag={onScanResult} onClose={onScanCancel} />
        </>
    );
};
```

Note that the `OCRCamera` component currently only supports viewing in portrait.
