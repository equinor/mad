This library adds basic drawing capabilities for your apps. It features a ready to use Signature Pad and an [EDS](https://loop.equinor.com/en/stories/eds-design-system) themed Image Markup tool.
The library also exposes functionality for creating your own solution.

## 🖌️ How to use
The library currently exposes two ready-made (reffered to as premades) solutions.

### 🖋️ Signature Pad
The Signature Pad component comes with a signature field, a clear button and the ability to create snapshots. A simple implementation looks like this:
```ts
import { Button } from "react-native";
import { SignaturePad } from "@equinor/react-native-skia-draw";
import { SnapshotHandle, SkiaDrawSnapshot } from "@equinor/react-native-skia-draw/dist/types";

const MySignaturePad = () => {
    const drawRef = useRef<SnapshotHandle>(null);
    const [myImage, setMyImage] = useState<SkiaDrawSnapshot>();

    const takeSnapshot = () => {
        if (drawRef.current?.makeImageSnapshot) {
            const result = drawRef.current.makeImageSnapshot();
            setMyImage(result);
        }
    };

    return (
        <>
            <SignaturePad ref={drawRef} />
            <Button
                title="Take snapshot!"
                onPress={takeSnapshot} />
        <>
    );
};
```

### 👩‍🎨 Image Markup

The Image Markup component comes with a simple control panel for some markup operations (stroke size, color selection, clear and undo), and the ability to draw on top of an imported image. A simple implementation looks like this:
```ts
import { Button } from "react-native";
import { ImageMarkup } from "@equinor/react-native-skia-draw";
import { SnapshotHandle, SkiaDrawSnapshot } from "@equinor/react-native-skia-draw/dist/types";

const MyImageMarkup = ({
    myImageAsAnEncodedString,
}:
{
    myImageAsAnEncodedString: string;
}) => {
    const drawRef = useRef<SnapshotHandle>(null);
    const [myImage, setMyImage] = useState<SkiaDrawSnapshot>();

    const takeSnapshot = () => {
        if (drawRef.current?.makeImageSnapshot) {
            const result = drawRef.current.makeImageSnapshot();
            setMyImage(result);
        }
    };

    return (
        <>
            <ImageMarkup
                ref={drawRef}
                markupImage={myImageAsAnEncodedString} />
            <Button
                title="Take snapshot!"
                onPress={takeSnapshot} />
        <>
    );
};
```
