# React Native Mad Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

Mad Tag Optical Character Recognition (OCR) adds a camera component that recognizes and highlights
text in real-time. The highlighted text can also be selected by the user. This is useful for tasks
such as scanning tags on Equinor facilities, but can also be used to scan other types of text.

## üñåÔ∏è How to use

This library exports a component called `OCRCamera` that you can import into your project. The
example below shows how it can be used.

```tsx
import { OCRCamera } from "@equinor/react-native-mad-tag-ocr";

export const MyComponent = () => {
    const { hasPermission, requestPermission } = useCameraPermission();

    useFocusEffect(() => void requestPermission());

    const onScanResult = (tag: string) => {
        // do someting here
    };

    const onScanCancel = () => {
        // do something here
    };

    return <OCRCamera onSelectTag={onScanResult} onClose={onScanCancel} />;
};
```

Remember to call the `requestPermission` function from `react-native-vision-camera` before using the
OCR camera. Also, if your project is using the [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
package, you can call `useFocusEffect` to make sure permission is requested every time you navigate
to the OCR camera. This ensures the user is always asked for permissions even if the user initially
clicked decline.

Note that the OCR camera only supports viewing in portrait mode.
