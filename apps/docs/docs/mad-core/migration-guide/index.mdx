# Migration guide

This guide assumes you are on the old stack, with
[`mad-expo-core`](https://github.com/equinor/mad-expo-core) and
[`react-native-salute`](https://github.com/equinor/react-native-salute). However, it should be
possible to follow this guide even if you are installing `mad-core` in a brand new app

_note: this package is new. Expect bugs. Expect lacking documentation. If you have any issues,
PLEASE create an issue. We want to make this great, but it's impossible to make it great without
your input_

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
