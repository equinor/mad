# Step 1: Installation

Run `npm install`

Next, install `@equinor/mad-core` and it's peer dependencies
`@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`, `@react-navigation/native`,
`react-native-safe-area-context`, `react-native-gesture-handler`, and
`@react-native-community/netinfo`. _note: Any issues with installation? Do you suspect some
peer-dependencies are missing? Create an issue!_
