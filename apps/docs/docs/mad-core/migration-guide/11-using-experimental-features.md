# Using experimental features (optional)

Some functionalities that are implemented but not mature enough for widespread use will be made
available as an experimental option for developers to test out.

Currently there are no experimental features.

The `mad-core` package should handle most of the authentication logic for you. If there are certain
usages in your app that use any `mad-auth` functions directly, you can import these functions
directly as normal. If you want to learn more about this feature please check out the `README.md` in
`mad-auth/Expo-AuthSession`
