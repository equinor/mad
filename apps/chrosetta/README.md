This app exists to test out packages that only run on Rosetta simulators. We use this app in order
to not mess up simple workflow in Chronicles.

In order to test the OCR feature you have to build the app to a physical device that has a camera.
To do this, first build the project to the device using xcode and then start the app from the
`chrosetta` folder using `yarn start`.
